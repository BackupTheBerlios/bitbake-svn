	* Improve documentation generation.  Use a decent set of
	  autoconf macros to handle selection of the types of
	  doxygen output (taken from the "doxample" project).
	* Use 'check' (http://check.sourceforge.net/) for unit testing.
	* Add basic variable insert/remove/lookup implementations for the
	  bitbake metadata (RAM backed for now).
