A new approach to parsing BitBake files.


This parser will be licensed under the post card licensed until it
is usable.


The approach:
    We parse all files independly and only once and we keep these files
    as AbstractSyntaxTree around (only if we consume too much memory
    we will throw them away.
    This means we will keep .bbclass, .conf and .inc in memory always,
    we will try to not parse these files over and over again.

    When parsing a BB File/Master File/Root we will build the AST for
    the included and required files we will place references of these
    ASTs in the Root Tree.

    Once we are done building and linking the Tree we will evaluate it
    to a bb.data instance.
