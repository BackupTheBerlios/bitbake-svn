-Separate the Ast from the Visitor. I already removed methods from AstItem
 now the Visitor needs to be cleaned
-Implement the visitor methods with xxx, FIXME, TODO
-Test the parser
-Integrate the parser into BitBake and write a special compare utility.
 We will parse the data with the new and old parser and then compare
 the dictionary key by key. We also need to take a look at the defined
 methods. This should give us pretty good results.
