TODO List
---------
NOTE: This is a very simple library with a specific purpose in mind, but we want to
make sure it's done right, since performance or scalability problems could impact the
entirety of bitbake and bitbake-ng. --CML

[ ] Fix up the API to accomidate proper error handling, in order to respond to the user
    and let them know what's going on.  A common problem would be not having write access
    to the default BBDATAPATH.  Perhaps a more sane default for a normal user would be a
    file in /var/tmp.
[ ] Test repeatedly the basic variable set/get/delete operations.
[ ] Document whether or not the set functions copy the strings of the key/value or use
    them as is, in the doxygen markup.
[ ] Code/test/sanity check variable attribute operations.
[ ] Code/test the last modif date function.
[ ] Profile the code to ensure it will meet our needs.
[ ] If necessary, optimize the bottlenecks.
[ ] Start using it.
