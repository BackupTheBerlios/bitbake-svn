[x] Add the lookup/insert/remove functions for both vars and var attrs.
[ ] Add handling of scopes (parent/child relationships for variable lookups).
    bb_data_insert_parent(gpointer data, gpointer parent, int index);
    bb_data_remove_parent(gpointer data, gpointer parent);
    bb_data_get_parents(gpointer data);
    Add new parameter to the lookup functions to specify whether the lookup is
    local to a specific recipe, or whether it should look to the parent scopes as
    well.  Note that the bitbake recipe lookup functions will behave just like these,
    making it painless to either implement your own, or just use these as is.
[ ] Add the last modif date function.
[ ] Add a rudamentary bitbake recipe handler to bitbake that uses this library, to
    ensure that bitbake-data meets its needs.
[ ] Add clean error handling so that recipe handlers can report the cause.
