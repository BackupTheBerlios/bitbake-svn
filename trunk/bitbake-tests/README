The purpose of this directory is to test the
python bitbake implementation. The unittest
test module is used for this purpose.

What do we test:
    - The fetchers (git,svn,cvs,svk,file,http) and the fetch
      module itself
    - The python parser
    - The data module(s)
    - The selection of different PROVIDERS
    - BBCollection handling
    - Whatever was once broken
