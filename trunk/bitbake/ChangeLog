Changes in bitbake 1.2.1:
	The 1.2.1 release is meant as a intermediate release to lay the
ground for more radical changes. The most notable changes are:

	-Do not hardcode {}, use bb.data.init() instead if you want to
get a instance of a data class
	-bb.data.init() is a factory and the old bb.data methods are delegates
	-Do not use deepcopy use bb.data.createCopy() instead.
	-Removed default arguments in bb.fetch
