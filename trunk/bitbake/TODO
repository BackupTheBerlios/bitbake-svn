On popular request by popular people a list of tasks to-do:

	-Kill insecure usage of os.system either by properly escaping
         the strings or a faster replacement not involving /bin/sh
	-Unpack only the real file and do not use wild-cards (is that the case)
	-Introduce a -p option to automatically hotshot/profile the

	-On generating the inter package deps do not parse each file multiply

	 requests it.
	-Cache dependencies separately and invalidate them when any file
         changed.
	-Fix data_dict.py
	-...
