Bitbake QA will hold Quality Assurance Resources:
    The primary user will be OpenEmbedded but it is useful
for any other user bitbake as well.

layout of the bitbake_qa module:

with specified parameters (for overrides)

modules/module_name/
    QA modules doing the actual tests


I hope to offer the following tests soon:

source_checker  - It will check if the sources can still be fetched
                  and generates reports
patch_checker   - It will check if the patches still applies
doc_checker     - It will check if all variables have a documentation
content_checker - It will check for common misusage in variables
depends_checker - Check if native packages RDEPEND on non-native packages
