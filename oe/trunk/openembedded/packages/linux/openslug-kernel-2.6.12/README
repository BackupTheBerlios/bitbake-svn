This directory contains *ONLY* the configuration for an openslug variant of
nslu2-kernel.

If patches are needed to the kernel they should go into a sub-directory of
nslu2-kernel and they should also almost certainly be added to the nslu2-kernel
.bb files.

See nslu2-kernel.inc for more information about where things come from,
there is a tree of directories for the patches and files to avoid duplicating
files!
