# This script is executed at the start and end of each run-level
# transition.  It is the first 'stop' script and the last 'start'
# script.
#
# 'stop'  sets the correct colour power LED to flash between the
#         two colours of the previous and next runlevel.
# 'start' sets the LED to steady
#
# 'red'   is the initial setting on kernel boot
#
# 'amber' is used for run levels S (from /linuxrc), 0 (halt),
#         1 (single user) and 6 (reboot).  halt and reboot do not
#         terminate therefore the LED remains flashing until the
#         kernel terminates.
#
# 'green' is used for run levels 2-5 - the normal user run levels.
#
# colours are 'g' (green), 'r' (red) or 'gr' (amber).
