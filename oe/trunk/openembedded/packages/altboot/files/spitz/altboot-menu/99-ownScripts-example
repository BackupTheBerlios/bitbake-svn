# This file will teach you how to implement your own scripts while using existing altboot
# code.

# /sbin/init.altboot searches /etc/altboot-menu for scripts. It will only list scripts which
# return a title when run with the "title" parameter. 
# Script which do not return a title will never be shown in the boot menu!
# 
M_TITLE="altboot sample"

# We can use that to deactivate certain scripts:
exit 0

# The "title" parameter is implemented at the end of this script so it will never be reached
# and the script will simply be ignored by altboot.


# The die() function aborts the boot if something goes wrong and sets STDIN / STDERR / STDOUT
# correctly.
die() {
	echo "ERROR: $1" >/dev/tty0
	exec $SH_SHELL </dev/tty0 >/dev/tty0 2>&1
}

# This function is activated by init.altboot by calling this script with the "run" option
run_module() {

	# altboot.func contains re-useable code. If you intend to use check_target (see below)
	# you must keep this line. If not, delete it.
	test -e /etc/altboot.func && . /etc/altboot.func || die "ERROR: /etc/altboot.func not found. Check your installation!"	


	# The only thing you'll have to do is get your medium mounted.
	# The following lines mount a SD card on 2.4-series kernels on a Zaurus
