# We are building packages which are armvteb (big endian) for arm or thumbv5tb for
# thumb instructions.  The PACKAGE_ARCH should reflect this because generated code
# requires that instruction set support.

# FEEDS
#  The following lines define where on the internet UcSlugC looks for packages
#  when downloading new packages or updating existing packages.  Additional feeds
#  (such as a local feed) can be defined in local.conf
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add to the user's feeds from local.conf (there may be none)
#
#NOTE: at present there is no released feed for ucslugc, therefore this feed
# is set to the 'unstable' version.  In released images DISTRO_FEED will typically
# be DISTRO_VERSION.

# CMDLINE* macros define the kernel command line.  CMDLINE_DEBUG is provided
# to enable/disable debugging in the distro.  Here noirqdebug is used to
# remove the messages about unhandled interrupts - people debugging interrupt
# issues in the kernel need to cancel this (set CMDLINE_DEBUG empty in local.conf)
CMDLINE_DEBUG = "noirqdebug"

# IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND is run before making the image.  In UcSlugC the
# kernel image is removed from the root file system to recover the space used -
# UcSlugC is assumed to boot from a separate kernel image in flash (not in the
# root file system), if this is not the case the following must not be done!
IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND = "rm ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/boot/zImage*;"

# Building a full image.  If you add the following extra commands will be
# appended to the openslug-image build by classes/nslu2-jffs2-image.bbclass
# (note that you can, instead, simply add 'inherit nslu2-jffs2-image' to
# openslug-image.bb).  If you do this you will need to find a source for the
# LinkSys software to be placed in the full image - 'RedBoot' (the boot loader),
# 'Trailer' (just a bunch of bytes to flag the image as valid) and 'SysConf'
# (actually just a block of unset data - you could modify this to pre-configure
# the SysConf partition of the image).  If you own an NSLU2 then this data is
# already in the flash of the NSLU2 and you can download it (including new
# versions) from the LinkSys web site - the bbclass will output information
# about where to put the downloaded data.
#
#NOTE: you do not actually need the boot loader in normal use because it is
# *not* overwritten by a standard upslug upgrade, so you can make an image with
# just non-LinkSys software which can be flashed into the NSLU2.

#INHERIT += " nslu2-jffs2-image"

# EXTRA PACKAGES
# --------------
# UcSlugC builds an openslug-image with no extra packages - to add packages to the
# firmware copy this file (to make a new 'distro' configuration file) and change
# the definition below to include the requirements.
# NOTE: as built this system will *not* be able to boot off anything other than
# the flash file system ('turnup' will not work).  You need to add the filesystem
# modules for your chosen root file system (and any others which will be used).
# See openslug.conf for a more full-featured system!
