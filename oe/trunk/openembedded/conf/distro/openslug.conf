# Filesystem selection: set in local.conf to override.  Adding entries
# here adds the module to the image.  The module must be built as part
# of openslug-kernel (i.e. it must be specified as a module in the
# defconfig file).  The NLS support charset modules must be given
# explicitly and must match the codepage/iocharset and NLS handling
# for the file systems which require them.  The installed lanugage
# set is minimal but sufficient for any file system (since it uses
# utf8).  See http://www.nslu2-linux.orgwiki/HowTo/MountFATFileSystems
# for more information on the language behaviour of the DOS file
# systems.

# KERNEL LEVEL FILE SYSTEM SUPPORT
# --------------------------------

# boot (however you can do a simple flash file system boot - no
# attached disk - and install the nfs modules from ssh.)
